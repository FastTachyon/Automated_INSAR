    ## Overview\n,
    Here are the processing steps.\n,
    \n,
    ### Data source\n,
    #### Satellite products\n,
    We use L1 data from the SENTINEL-1A Interferometric Wide Swath Level 1 S Product. Data are downloaded via the [python scripts](data/download_2015NepalEarthquake.py) provided by the Alaska Satellite Facility's [bulk download service][asf].\n,
    \n,
    #### Weather data\n,
    We use weather data from the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store][atmopspheric-data]. There is a utility scrip to download the atmospheric data corresponding to three geological events of interest; namely the Ridgecrest, CA, USA earthquakes of July 4th and 5th 2019, the Kilauea, HI, USA volcanic eruption of May 4th 2018 and the Kumamoto, KYU, Japan earthquake of April 16th 2016. The files have also been pushed to the repository for your convinience.\n,
    \n,
    ##### ERA5 data download script\n,
    \n,
    Once the steps (found [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+install+and+use+CDS+API+on+Windows) *Note: The .cdspapirc file need to be created manually for Windows user) to create a login for ERA5's API have been completed, atmospheric data can be easily downloaded the query(ies) string(s) in the `ERA5APICalls.py` script. Example of queries can be obtained from https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=form.\n,
    \n,
    ### Processing steps\n,
    To generate an interferogram, Level 1 data is preprocessed using the following steps, similar the example found at [this repository][sentinel-1-snappy].\n,
     1.  Open source files\n,
     2.  Select chosen subswath\n,
     3.  Apply Geocoding\n,
     4.  Burst co-registration using orbit and (digital elevation map) DEM\n,
     5.  Estimate constant range and azimuth offsets for the whole image\n,
     6.  Compute interferogram\n,
     7.  Debursts the TOPSAR product\n,
     8.  Compute and subtract topographic phase\n,
     9.  Multilook: Average spectra over a set number of bands\n,
     10. Apply terrain corrections to remove shadows and order terrain-induces artefacts\n,
